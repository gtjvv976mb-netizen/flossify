## Standing constraints

These came from the owner over many rounds and reversing any of them undoes
work that was already rejected once. Do not quietly relax them.

- **No 3D models.** A Three.js scene was built and deliberately removed.
- **No human faces** in any image. Equipment, teeth, braces, tools, empty rooms.
  Three photographs were deleted for containing people.
- **No tooth chart on the home page.** The odontogram lives on the patient
  record only, and was removed from the home page twice.
- **No invented clinic branding and no third-party brand marks in imagery.**
  Two generated shots were thrown away for lettering a fictional clinic name on
  a wall and for a real autoclave manufacturer's logo.
- The site is judged on **user experience and user-friendliness**, for **both
  patients and clinic owners**.

## Art direction — Swiss clinical

Three rules govern everything. Breaking any one collapses the page back into a
generic SaaS template, which is what the owner rejected.

1. **Nothing is rounded.** `border-radius: 0` everywhere.
2. **Nothing casts a shadow.** Separation is 1px rules and whitespace.
3. **Uppercase lives in the mono face alone** (`.meta`, `.sec-no`).

Type is **Archivo** (variable, display + body) and **IBM Plex Mono** (all
metadata), both self-hosted from `public/fonts/`. Do not re-add Google Fonts:
it is a third-party connection on a page about medical records, and it is
blocked outright in some sandboxes, which silently renders everything in
Helvetica.

`src/styles/global.css` is the whole system. Read the comment at the top of the
`@layer components` block before editing it — component rules **must** stay
inside that layer or they beat Tailwind utilities on equal specificity.

## The tour

`#tour` is the opening of the page: one continuous 30s take from the pavement
to the chair, scrubbed by scroll (`scroll position -> video.currentTime`), with
the H1 in its first caption. Nothing scales; the forward motion is in the
footage. Four captions — Outside, Reception, The corridor, The chair — switch at
the moments the footage arrives in each room (`from` fractions on `stops` in
`index.astro`, read off a frame sheet), not at equal quarters. Six viewports of
scroll for 30s of film, the same 5s-per-viewport pace as the earlier 20s take.
See `docs/generation.md` for how the film was made and how to regenerate it.

- Encoded with a **5-frame GOP** so scrubbing lands on a real frame. This is why
  the files are larger than a streaming encode, and why **VP9 loses** here — it
  was measured at 5.05MB against H.264's 4.77MB at worse quality. Ship H.264.
- Phones get `tour-960.mp4`; `prefers-reduced-motion` gets **no `src` at all**,
  so the film is never downloaded for someone who will not see it.

## Verification — measure, do not eyeball

Every bug that cost real time in this project was invisible in the markup and
invisible in a glance. Screenshots are for judging design; numbers are for
judging correctness.

- Read back `getBoundingClientRect()` after layout changes.
- Sample computed colours and compute contrast ratios; do not judge by eye.
  Small mono text is 12px, so it needs **4.5:1**, not 3:1.
- For video, extract real frames with ffmpeg and measure against those.
- `node scripts/film.mjs shots http://localhost:4321/` runs the film checks
  headlessly (scrub mapping, caption switching, reveal, 390px, reduced motion).
  It needs a VP9 copy at `dist/video/tour-test.webm`; the header of the script
  says how to make one.
- Check `prefers-reduced-motion`, keyboard order, and 390px width every time.
- The owner's Mac has Reduce Motion on. `?motion=on` on any page URL overrides
  it for that load (class `force-motion` on `<html>`), so the film can be
  demoed and scrub-tested there. Test both states.

## Traps already hit

- **`@layer components`** — unlayered, `.media { position: relative }` beat an
  `absolute` utility and parked the hero photo at intrinsic size in a corner.
- **`.gitignore` anchoring** — a bare `shots/` also matched `public/shots/`, so
  the screenshots the home page depends on were silently untracked. Anchor
  repo-root-only ignores with a leading slash.
- **Minified template literals** — the bundler emits `` `/video/x.mp4` ``.
  Path-rewriting that only handles `"` and `'` misses it and 404s the film.
- **CSS asset URLs are absolute and unquoted** — `url(/fonts/x.woff2)`. Rewriting
  the HTML is not enough; rewrite the stylesheet too.
- **Headless Chromium has no H.264**, so the shipped MP4 cannot be played in it.
  Verify the scrub mechanism with a VP9 copy and the visuals from decoded frames.
- **Screenshot selectors** — the first `<table>` on the workspace is HMO claims,
  not the day queue. Pin captures to heading text (`scripts/shoot.mjs`).
- Do not `pkill -f 'astro preview'`; it kills the agent's own shell. Use a new
  port instead.

## Sample client sites — `public/samples/`

`public/samples/swiftcare/` is a self-contained clinic website (plain HTML, CSS
and JS, no build step) that shows the site-building service. It is framed on
`/websites/` and served as-is, so it is exactly the folder a clinic would
receive.

It is a **concept redesign of a real clinic's site** — SwiftCare Dental Clinic,
Tarlac City (swiftcaredental.com) — made with the clinic's public branding,
photographs and price list at the owner's direction. Its Book and Staff links
open the clinic's real booking flow and staff login. If that relationship ever
changes, swap the folder for a fictional clinic rather than editing it in place.

It is a **client deliverable, not a Flossify page**, and it deliberately does
not follow the Swiss rules above: a patient expects a clinic site to feel warm,
so the sample is rounded, shadowed and set in a serif, in the clinic's own gold
and espresso. Keep that exception inside the folder. Its CSS is scoped to its
own document and imports nothing from `global.css`. The clinic's service
photographs are its own stock images and some show people; the no-faces rule
governs Flossify's imagery, not a client's.

Rules that still hold there:

- **No third-party fonts or scripts.** Fraunces and Plus Jakarta Sans are
  self-hosted in `assets/fonts/` (latin subset, variable). The one embed is the
  Google Maps iframe in the contact section, lazy-loaded.
- **`noindex`, and labelled as a concept** in the top bar, footer and on
  `/websites/`, so it never competes with or passes for the clinic's live site.
- Health copy (first aid, aftercare, the Smile Finder) is general guidance and
  says so on the page. A dentist reviews it before any real client ships.
- Content lives in `js/data.js`; the palette is the token block at the top of
  `css/styles.css`. `?motion=on` on the URL forces the animations on for demos
  on a machine with Reduce Motion enabled.

## The patient side — `/find/`

Built from `docs/service-map.md`. Rules that shaped it, and that hold:

- **Only availability the clinic can honour.** Slots come from the clinic's
  hours, the chosen dentist's days and the service's chair time; clinics not on
  the workspace get a labelled *request* path, never a calendar. The "taken"
  slots are a stable hash of the slot until a real schedule exists.
- **No account.** Name, mobile, reason. A known mobile is greeted by name.
- **Status is Manila time and never colour alone** — the dot changes and the
  words change with it (`statusFor` in `src/lib/availability.ts`).
- **Every trust claim names its source.** "PRC licence · checked <date>" means a
  person looked it up; there is no API. Specialty is shown only for the seven
  Board-recognised fields. HMO chips are what the clinic reported and say
  "confirm with your HMO".
- **Hooks are `data-*` attributes and must not collide.** Two bugs came from
  `$('[data-tip]')` matching the chips' own `data-tip` and `$('[data-done]')`
  matching progress marks. A hook that is queried with `querySelector` gets a
  name nothing else uses.
- **Toggle the `hidden` attribute, never the `hidden` utility class**, on
  anything JavaScript shows later; the class wins and the element stays gone.
- Bookings live in `localStorage` (`flossify:bookings`) with a three-minute
  undo. On a live clinic the same submit lands in the workspace.

## Open — read before shipping

**The clinic workspace has no authentication.** `/c/[clinic]/patients/` exposes
patient records to anyone who guesses a clinic slug. Under the Data Privacy Act
of 2012 that is a reportable breach, not a rough edge. `src/data/schema.sql`
already defines forced row-level security keyed on `app.clinic_id`; the missing
piece is login and session handling that sets it. Keep the prototype banner on
every workspace page until that exists.

`lqip.json` and `shot-size.json` are generated. Regenerate them whenever the
images or screenshots change, or the reserved boxes drift out of step.
